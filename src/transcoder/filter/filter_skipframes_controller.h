// Decides how many frames the FPS filter should skip so a video filter stays within the
// capacity of the pipeline behind it.
//
// Measured over one evaluation window (1s):
//
//   frame cost    what one frame takes: the time spent processing plus the time blocked
//                 handing it off
//   utilization   the share of the window the thread was busy rather than waiting for input
//
// Decided from the two together:
//
//   raise    fully busy AND losing input. The frame cost sets the target
//            level; the rise is one step per window, and only after a second window agrees
//   lower    anything else, once the recovery hold passes - 20% at a time, down to what
//            the frame cost allows rather than straight off
//
// Three traps this is shaped around:
//
//   * Judge against the INPUT rate, never the output rate the level aims at. Skipping
//     lowers that output target, so the filter would keep meeting a bar it just lowered
//     while the upstream queue grew.
//   * Busy is not overloaded. The encoder queue is two frames deep, so the handoff blocks
//     even on a chain that keeps up. Idle time in the window is what tells them apart.
//   * A level that works erases its own evidence. Handoff time falls to zero once the
//     level is right, so a step down is measured where the filter is the bottleneck and
//     probed where the encoder is, with the hold backing off while probes keep failing.
//
// Computation only: no clock, no logging, no FPS filter. The caller supplies the time and
// applies the result, which is what makes the tuning ratios testable.
